About Me
---------------

Hello brothers and sometimes sisters in pain. I'm MatÄ›j Smetana (englified: Matthew Cream), from Czech Republic.

'Bout me:
* I am a student so I am learning programming, not in school tho.
* I wanna make games.
* JAVA is **evil**
* C++ is way better
* I like low-level stuff
* I like *8-bit* computers

All hath been said, henceforth thou shalt stride and through use, greater skill shall arise in thine hands!
